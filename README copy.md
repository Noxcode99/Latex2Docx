Latex2docx
==========

Latex2docx is a Python program that converts latex files into MS Word .docx files. Since Latex can do much more than MS Word, do not expect every Latex file can be converted, and do not expect converted files can have the same good output as Latex can do.

Usage
======

You can convert a latex file by using

    Latex2docx.py texfile.tex
	
This will convert texfile.tex to texfile.docx .
